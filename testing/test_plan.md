# Testing Plan for Secure Geospatial Blockchain

## 1. Backend Testing

### API Endpoints Testing
- [ ] Test file upload endpoint (`/api/data/upload`)
- [ ] Test file listing endpoint (`/api/data/files`)
- [ ] Test encryption endpoint (`/api/data/encrypt`)
- [ ] Test blockchain storage endpoint (`/api/blockchain/store`)
- [ ] Test blockchain retrieval endpoint (`/api/blockchain/retrieve/<data_id>`)
- [ ] Test access control endpoints (grant/revoke/check)

### Encryption Testing
- [ ] Test AES encryption with various file sizes
- [ ] Test RSA key encryption
- [ ] Verify decryption works correctly
- [ ] Measure encryption/decryption performance

### Blockchain Testing
- [ ] Test smart contract deployment
- [ ] Test storing data references
- [ ] Test retrieving data references
- [ ] Test access control mechanisms
- [ ] Verify transaction success and gas usage

## 2. Frontend Testing

### Components Testing
- [ ] Test file upload component
- [ ] Test file listing component
- [ ] Test encryption form
- [ ] Test blockchain storage component
- [ ] Test data retrieval component
- [ ] Test access control component
- [ ] Test map visualization component

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete workflow: upload → encrypt → store → retrieve
- [ ] Test access control workflow: grant → check → revoke → check
- [ ] Test error handling and user feedback

## 3. Security Testing

- [ ] Test against SQL injection
- [ ] Verify proper encryption key handling
- [ ] Check for secure API endpoints
- [ ] Test blockchain transaction security
- [ ] Verify access control mechanisms

## 4. Performance Testing

- [ ] Measure API response times under load
- [ ] Test with large geospatial datasets
- [ ] Measure encryption/decryption times
- [ ] Assess blockchain transaction times
